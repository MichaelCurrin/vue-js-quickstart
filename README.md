## About

### What is Vue?

Vue is a JavaScript framework for building web interfaces. If you've heard of React - Vue is similar to React, but Vue is newer, more popular (in GH stars) and easier to learn.

This project provides a quickstart Vue app, which doesn't do much but sets up the skeleton so you can create a Vue app. See for example the minimal [src/App.vue](/src/App.vue) script which includes an HTML template, JavaScript code and CSS code.

### How to use this project

Here is what you can do with this project:

<!--
- See the live demo served on GitHub Pages to see the site in action.
-->

- Click the _Use this Template_ button to add the project to your own repos, then run it locally and on GitHub pages.
- Follow the [Create a fresh quickstart](#create-a-fresh-quickstart) section to create a new Vue app locally, using the Vue CLI.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/learn-to-code/blob/master/en/topics/scripting_languages/JavaScript/node.md)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/)


## Installation

### Install system dependencies

Install Node.js and Yarn - see these [gist instructions](https://gist.github.com/MichaelCurrin/bdc34c554fa3023ee81449eb77375fcb).

### Clone repo

Clone this repo, or your own project created from the template.

```sh
$ git@github.com:MichaelCurrin/vue-js-quickstart.git
```

### Install project dependencies

From the project root, run:

```sh
$ yarn install
```

### Recommended extensions

You can install an extension for VS Code for syntax highlighting of `.vue` files.


## Usage
> How to run the Vue app locally

### Run

Compile and hot-reload for development.

```sh
$ yarn serve
```

### Build

Compile and minify for production.

```sh
$ yarn build
```

### Lint and fix

```sh
$ yarn lint
```

### Customize configuration

See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).


## Deploy

A Vue app needs a _build_ step to compile the scripts to plain JavaScript. This can be served then as static assets, without a Node.js server.

This repo includes a Github workflow to **test** the app - see the [build_app.yml]/.github/workflows/build_app.yml) workflow file.

This does a production build of the app, but it does **not** persist the built site for serving. But, that can be done by extending the workflow. Or, use Netlify or similar tools to deploy and serve.


## Create a fresh quickstart

How use Vue's builtin quickstart CLI to create a new project. This flow was used originally as the base of this repo.

Ensure you have NodeJS and optionally Yarn installed first.

### Use npx

Use this is install and run the vue CLI to create a new project. This will not persist any package in your global packages.

```sh
$ npx @vue/cli create --default my-project
```


### Install and run the CLI

#### Install the CLI

Install [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/).

This can be installed globally:

```sh
$ npm install -g @vue/cli
$ # OR
$ yarn global add @vue/cli
```

#### Use the create command

Create the base. You'll be asked a few questions, like choose between NPM or Yarn approach.

```sh
$ vue create my-project
```

Add the `--default` flag to skip prompts.

#### Use a GUI

You can also create and manage projects using a graphical interface with the vue ui command:

```sh
$ vue ui
```

The above command will open a browser window with a GUI that guides you through the project creation process.

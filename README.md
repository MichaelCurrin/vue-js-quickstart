## About

### What is Vue?

Vue is a JavaScript framework for building web interfaces. If you've heard of React - Vue is similar to React, but Vue is newer, more popular (in GH stars) and easier to learn.

This project provides a quickstart Vue app, which doesn't do much but sets up the skeleton so you can create a Vue app. See for example the minimal [src/App.vue](/src/App.vue) script which includes an HTML template, JavaScript code and CSS code.

See the links at the top - view the live demo and then create your own repo from the template.

Or follow the [Create a fresh quickstart](#create-a-fresh-quickstart) section to create a new Vue app from scratch, using the Vue CLI.

If you are looking for a multi-page Vue app template, see this repo - [MichaelCurrin/vue-router-quickstart](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/vue-router-quickstart).

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/learn-to-code/blob/master/en/topics/scripting_languages/JavaScript/node.md)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/)


## Installation
> How to setup the app locally

### Install system dependencies

Install Node.js and Yarn - see these [gist instructions](https://gist.github.com/MichaelCurrin/bdc34c554fa3023ee81449eb77375fcb).

### Clone

Clone the repo - or your own repo generated from the template

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:MichaelCurrin/vue-quickstart.git
$ cd vue-quickstart
```

### Install project dependencies

Install Node packages.

```sh
$ yarn install
```

### Recommended extensions

To add syntax highlighting of `.vue` files in VS Code, install an extension such as [Vetur](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=octref.vetur).


## Usage
> How to run the app locally

### Run

Compile and start a hot-reloading dev server.

```sh
$ yarn serve
```

Open in the browser:

- https://localhost:8080

### Build

Compile and minify for production.

```sh
$ yarn build
```

View the output in the unversioned `dist` directory.

### Lint and fix

```sh
$ yarn lint
```

### Customize configuration

See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).


## Deploy

A Vue app needs a _build_ step to compile the scripts to plain JavaScript. This output can then be served then a static asset directory, without a Node.js server running.

This repo includes a GitHub workflow to build the app - see the [build_app.yml]/.github/workflows/build_app.yml) workflow file.

This does a production build of the app, but it does **not** persist the built site for serving on GitHub Pages. That can be done easily by extending the workflow. See this [workflow](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/react-create-app-quickstart/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml) which deploys a React app. Or use Netlify instead.


## Create a fresh quickstart

How use Vue's builtin quickstart CLI to create a new project. This flow was used originally as the base of this repo.

Ensure you have Node.js and optionally Yarn installed first.

### Use npx

Use this is install and run the vue CLI to create a new project. This will not persist any package in your global packages.

```sh
$ npx @vue/cli create --default my-project
```

### Install and run the CLI

#### Install the CLI

Install [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/).

This can be installed globally:

```sh
$ npm install -g @vue/cli
$ # OR
$ yarn global add @vue/cli
```

#### Use the create command

Create the base. You'll be asked a few questions, like choose between NPM or Yarn approach.

```sh
$ vue create my-project
```

Add the `--default` flag to skip prompts.

#### Use a GUI

You can also create and manage projects using a graphical interface with the vue ui command:

```sh
$ vue ui
```

The above command will open a browser window with a GUI that guides you through the project creation process.
